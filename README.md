# Exploratory-Data-Querying
This project involves conducting exploratory and in-depth analysis of the sales databases of a food retailing store chain in Vietnam using SQL. The key objectives of this project are to understand more about the company, such as ranking and classifying top-performing products, and to understand customers' needs based on their time spent in-store buying products.
